        <p>Wikipedia says: <blockquote>Sous vide (/suːˈviːd/; French for 'under vacuum'),[1] also known as low-temperature, long-time (LTLT) cooking,[2][3][4] is a method of cooking invented by the French chef Georges Pralus in 1974,[5][6] in which food is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually one to seven hours, and more than three days in some cases) at a precisely regulated temperature.

The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 °C (130 to 140 °F) for red meat, 66 to 71 °C (150 to 160 °F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>Why Sous Vide is my favorite cooking method</h2>
        <p>It's absolutely delicious!  If you've ever eaten a chicken sandwhich at Shake Shack, and wondered how they got the chicken to be perfectly moist, Sous Vide is the answer.  However, it's important to note that not everything great comes without a cost.  Chicken breast takes about 2 hours using this method, a brisquet can take 48 hours.  So, depending on the frequency of use, Sous Vide may not be conducive to maintaining a good marriage, especially when your wife is starving... and doesn't want to wait 24 hours to be fed.  <em>But</em> it can be entertaining to watch your family descend into a chaotic mess whilst waiting for their food.</p>
        <p>However, with a little planning, no one dies, and more importantly, no one has to wait. You'll be excited to find that steaks, chicken, and pork all end up being super moist, and pleasently comparable to any menu offering at high-end restaurants. Even Octopus which can have the texture and consistency of a rubber tire, turns out being consistently agreeable. </p>
