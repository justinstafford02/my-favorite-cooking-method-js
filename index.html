        <p>Wikipedia says: <blockquote>Sous vide (/suːˈviːd/; French for 'under vacuum'),[1] also known as low-temperature, long-time (LTLT) cooking,[2][3][4] is a method of cooking invented by the French chef Georges Pralus in 1974,[5][6] in which food is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually one to seven hours, and more than three days in some cases) at a precisely regulated temperature.

The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 °C (130 to 140 °F) for red meat, 66 to 71 °C (150 to 160 °F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.</blockquote></p>

        <h2>This is why this is my favorite cooking method</h2>
        <p>It's important to note that this method is not conducive to having a good marriage, especially when your wife is a hungry... and doesn't want to wait for 24 hours for her meal.  <em>But</em> it's fun to see my family lose their minds waiting for their food.</p>
        <p>However, with a little planning, no one dies or, and more importantly, has to wait....and steaks, chicken, pork all end up being super moist, and comparable to any high-end restaurant.</p>
